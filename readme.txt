== Description ==

Next to all appearances of each commenter's name in the admin, shows a count of their total number of comments, linked to a listing of those comments.

By default, it is not possible to tell via a single glance whether a particular commenter has commented before, and if so, how many times.

This plugin adds a handy feature to the WordPress admin pages to allow you to:

* Quickly identify a first-time commenter
* Quickly identify unfamiliar commenters that have in fact commented before
* Quickly see how many total comments a particular commenter has made, and how many comments are pending
* Easily go to a listing of all comments by a commenter, in order to see what and when they last commented, or what/when they first commented

This plugin adds a linked comment count next to every appearance of a commenter in the admin.  The link takes you to the admin page listing all comments for that particular commenter.  The count displays all approved comments attributed to that commenter.  If you hover over the comment count, the hover text indicates how many pending comments they also have, if any.

Specifically, the linked comment count appears next to commenters in:

* The "Edit Comments" listing of comments (including comment search results)
* The "Edit Comments for 'Post Title'" listing of post-specific comments
* The "Discussion" box of the "Edit Post" page for a post with comments
* The "Recent Comments" admin dashboard widget

Commenters are identified by the email address they provided when commenting.  If your site does not require that commenters submit their email address when commenting, then this plugin will be of little value to you.
